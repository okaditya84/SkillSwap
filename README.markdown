## üöÄ Getting Started
To set up the SkillSwap platform locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/skillswap.git
   cd skillswap
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on `.env.example`.
   - Set up database credentials and other environment variables (e.g., PORT, DATABASE_URL).

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.
   - Run the database migrations:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run migrate
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
   - The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üåø Branches
The repository is organized into two main branches:

- **frontend**: Contains the React.js-based client-side code, including user interface components, pages, and client-side logic for interacting with the backend API. This branch handles the rendering of user profiles, skill discovery, and swap management interfaces.
- **backend**: Contains the Node.js and Express-based server-side code, including API endpoints, database interactions with MongoDB, and business logic for user management, swap requests, and admin controls.
